## Overview
This project includes a series of labs and exercises assigned in the AIML course at IIIT Hyderabad. Each lab focuses on specific machine learning concepts, such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and supervised learning techniques.

## Installation
To get started, you need Python 3.6 or higher. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shresth-Agarwal/FMML_Project_And_Labs.git
   cd FMML_Project_And_Labs
2. Download any datasets specified within each lab folder.

## Project Structure
- **Labs/**: Contains individual lab notebooks, each covering a different aspect of machine learning.
- **Datasets/**: Holds example datasets used within the labs.
- **README.md**: This file, providing a project overview and setup instructions.

Each lab is presented as a Jupyter Notebook, which allows you to follow along, run the code, and gain hands-on experience.

## Usage
To run a lab, navigate to the `Labs/` folder and open a Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Labs/<lab_name>.ipynb
```

## Learning Outcomes
By working through these labs, you will:

Gain foundational knowledge of core machine learning concepts.
Understand data preprocessing and explore key algorithms.
Learn about model evaluation techniques and parameter tuning.
